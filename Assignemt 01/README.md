# Assignment 1 – Module 2: Basic Python Concepts

This repository contains **Assignment 1** for **Module 2: Basic Python Concepts**. The purpose of this assignment is to apply fundamental Python programming concepts through hands-on practice using simple, well-defined tasks.

The assignment consists of **two independent Python programs**, each designed to demonstrate core concepts such as user input, operators, string handling, and output formatting.

## Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations

### Objective
To create a Python program that performs basic arithmetic operations using user-provided input.

### Description
This program:
1. Takes **two numbers** as input from the user.
2. Performs the following mathematical operations:
   - Addition  
   - Subtraction  
   - Multiplication  
   - Division  
3. Displays the result of each operation on the screen.

### Concepts Used
- `input()` for user input  
- Type conversion (`int` / `float`)  
- Arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)  
- Output using `print()`

### Expected Output
The program displays the calculated results of all four operations for the given input values.

## Task 2: Create a Personalized Greeting

### Objective
To create a Python program that generates a personalized greeting using user input.

### Description
This program:
1. Takes the user's **first name** and **last name** as input.
2. Concatenates the first and last name to form a **full name**.
3. Prints a **personalized greeting message** using the full name.

### Concepts Used
- User input handling  
- String concatenation  
- Output formatting using `print()`
