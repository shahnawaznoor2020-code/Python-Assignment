# Assignment 2 – Module 2: Control Flow and Loops in Python

This repository contains **Assignment 2** for **Module 2**, focusing on **control flow statements and loops** in Python.  
The objective of this assignment is to strengthen understanding of **conditional logic**, **loops**, and **basic arithmetic operations** through simple programs.

The assignment consists of **two independent Python programs**, each demonstrating a core programming concept.

## Task 1: Check Whether a Number is Even or Odd

### Objective
To create a Python program that determines whether a given number is **even** or **odd**.

### Description
This program:
1. Takes an **integer input** from the user.
2. Uses a **conditional expression (ternary operator)** to check if the number is even or odd.
3. Displays the appropriate result on the screen.

### Concepts Used
- `input()` for user input  
- Type conversion using `int`  
- Modulus operator (`%`)  
- Conditional (ternary) operator  
- Output using `print()`

### Expected Output
The program displays whether the entered number is **even** or **odd**.

## Task 2: Calculate the Sum of Numbers from 1 to 50

### Objective
To create a Python program that calculates the **sum of numbers from 1 to 50**.

### Description
This program:
1. Uses a `for` loop to iterate through numbers from **1 to 50**.
2. Adds each number to a running total.
3. Prints the final sum.

### Concepts Used
- `for` loop  
- `range()` function  
- Variable initialization  
- Arithmetic addition  
- Output using `print()`

### Expected Output
The program displays the **sum of all integers from 1 to 50**.
